    "short_description": "EEG Click is a Click boardâ„¢ that allows monitoring of brain activity. Although not suitable for clinical examination, it is quite sufficient to allow some insight into brain activity. EEG click is equipped with a high-sensitivity circuit which amplifies faint electrical signals from the brain, allowing them to be sampled by a host MCU.",
